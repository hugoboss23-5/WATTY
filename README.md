Your AI has amnesia. Every conversation starts from zero. Watty fixes that.

Watty is an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that gives **any AI** persistent memory. Install it once, and your AI remembers everything: conversations, documents, code, decisions. Locally. Privately. Forever.

**No cloud. No API keys. No monthly fees. Your data never leaves your machine.**

## Install in 60 seconds

```bash
pip install watty-ai[onnx]    # Recommended: ~100MB, no GPU needed
# pip install watty-ai[torch] # Full: ~2GB, includes PyTorch
# pip install watty-ai[fast]  # Add faiss for ANN search at scale
```

<details>
<summary>Development install</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hugoboss23-5/WATTY.git
cd WATTY
pip install -e ".[onnx,dev]"
```
</details>

Add to your Claude Desktop config:

**Mac/Linux:** `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "watty": {
      "command": "watty",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. Done. Watty is alive.

## Import your history

```bash
watty import chatgpt ~/Downloads/chatgpt-export.zip
watty import claude ~/Downloads/claude-export.json
watty import json ~/conversations.json
```

## Platform support

Watty speaks MCP over **stdio** and **HTTP/SSE**.

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Claude Desktop** | ✅ Works now | stdio transport |
| **Cursor** | ✅ Works now | stdio transport |
| **Windsurf** | ✅ Works now | stdio transport |
| **Claude Code** | ✅ Works now | stdio transport |
| **VS Code + Copilot** | ✅ Works now | Via MCP extension |
| **ChatGPT** | 🔧 HTTP transport ready | Server works, awaiting platform MCP support |
| **Gemini** | 🔧 HTTP transport ready | Server works, awaiting platform MCP support |
| **Grok** | 🔧 HTTP transport ready | Server works, awaiting platform MCP support |

stdio for local clients. `watty serve --http` for everything else.

## What happens next

Talk to your AI normally. Watty works in the background — no commands to memorize, no workflows to learn.

```
You:    "Hey Claude, scan my Documents folder"
Watty:  → Eats 847 files. Indexes everything. Deduplicates automatically.

You:    "What was that thing I wrote about distributed systems last month?"  
Watty:  → Finds it instantly. Semantic search, not keyword matching.

You:    "Remember that I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript for new projects"
Watty:  → Stored. Every future coding conversation just knows this.

You:    "What patterns do you see across all my notes?"
Watty:  → Clusters your knowledge. Surfaces connections you missed.
```

**Your AI doesn't announce that it's using Watty. It just _knows_ things.** The way a colleague remembers your preferences without being asked.

## 9 Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `watty_recall` | Search memory by **meaning**, not keywords |
| `watty_remember` | Store something important |
| `watty_scan` | Point at a folder — Watty eats everything worth eating |
| `watty_cluster` | Watty organizes his own mind into a knowledge graph |
| `watty_forget` | Delete anything. Your soul, your rules |
| `watty_surface` | Watty tells you what you didn't know you needed |
| `watty_reflect` | Map your entire mind — providers, topics, time range |
| `watty_context` | Lightning-fast pre-check — does Watty know about this? |
| `watty_stats` | Quick brain health check |

## What Watty can eat

Point Watty at any folder. He finds his own food:

`.txt` `.md` `.json` `.csv` `.log` `.py` `.js` `.ts` `.swift` `.rs` `.html` `.css` `.yaml` `.yml` `.toml` `.sh` `.bat` `.ps1`

He skips what he should (`.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, binaries) and deduplicates automatically. Re-scanning is always safe.

## Why Watty

| | Watty | Cloud memory tools | Other local tools |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Install** | `pip install -e .` | API keys + cloud accounts | Docker + databases + config |
| **Works with** | Any stdio MCP client | Usually one platform | Varies |
| **Data storage** | Local SQLite. Period. | Their servers | Local, but complex setup |
| **Search** | Semantic (by meaning) | Usually semantic | Keyword or hybrid |
| **File ingestion** | Point at folder, done | Manual upload | Complex pipelines |
| **Self-organization** | Automatic clustering | You organize it | You organize it |
| **Privacy** | Your machine. Nothing leaves. | Read the terms. | Usually local |
| **Cost** | Free forever | Free tier → paid | Free (usually) |
| **Code** | ~850 lines of logic. Audit in 20 min. | Proprietary | Thousands+ |

## Configuration

All optional. Watty works out of the box with zero configuration.

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `WATTY_HOME` | `~/.watty/` | Where the brain lives |
| `WATTY_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Sentence transformer model |
| `WATTY_EMBEDDING_BACKEND` | `auto` | `auto`, `onnx`, or `torch` |
| `WATTY_TOP_K` | `10` | Max memories per search |
| `WATTY_RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD` | `0.35` | Min similarity score (0-1) |
| `WATTY_CHUNK_SIZE` | `1500` | Characters per memory chunk |
| `WATTY_CHUNK_OVERLAP` | `200` | Overlap between chunks |
| `WATTY_DB_KEY` | auto-generated | Encryption key (overrides keyfile) |
| `WATTY_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging verbosity (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`) |

## FAQ

**Does it work with ChatGPT / Gemini / Grok?**
Yes. Run `watty serve --http` to start the HTTP/SSE server on `localhost:8766`, then point your MCP client at it. Same 9 tools, same brain.

**Why is the first install so large?**
If you install with `.[torch]`, `sentence-transformers` pulls in PyTorch (~2GB). Use `.[onnx]` instead — same model, ~100MB total, no GPU dependency. Watty auto-detects whichever backend you have.

**How much disk space does it use after install?**  
The embedding model is ~80MB. After that, your memories are just SQLite rows — thousands of documents fit in megabytes.

**Is my data really private?**
Watty is a local MCP server. Your data lives in `~/.watty/brain.db` on your machine, encrypted at rest with AES-256 if you `pip install watty-ai[encrypted]`. No network calls except downloading the embedding model the first time. Read the code — it's ~1000 lines of logic. You can audit it in 20 minutes.

**Can I back up my brain?**
`watty backup` creates a compressed archive with your database, encryption key, and manifest. `watty restore` brings it back. Or just copy `~/.watty/brain.db`.

**Can I delete specific memories?**  
Yes. `watty_forget` can delete by search query, specific IDs, provider, or date. Your soul, your rules.

**What's the embedding model?**  
[all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) — a 22M parameter sentence transformer. Small, fast, runs on any machine. No GPU needed.

**Will it slow down with thousands of memories?**
Recall stays under 2ms up to 10k memories with numpy brute-force. Install `pip install watty-ai[fast]` for faiss approximate nearest neighbor search at larger scales. Cluster time scales linearly (~30ms at 1k, ~660ms at 10k).

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

69 tests, runs in ~9 seconds, no PyTorch download needed (uses mock embeddings).

Run benchmarks:

```bash
python -m tests.bench    # Measures store, recall, cluster, scan at 100/1k/10k scales
```
