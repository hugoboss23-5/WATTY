A regular function is standalone with no implicit object context. Use methods when behavior belongs to a specific object.\n\nQ: What does the `@keyframes` decorator do? How does it modify the function below it?\nA: A decorator wraps a function inside another function. `@foo` above `def bar()` is shorthand for `bar = foo(bar)`. It lets you add behavior (logging, auth, caching) without changing the original function's code.\n\nQ: Why is `_web_start` async? What would happen if it were a regular function?\nA: Async lets the function pause while waiting for I/O (network, disk) without blocking other work. A regular function would block the entire thread until the I/O completes, freezing everything else.\n\nQ: Why do we `await` here? What happens if you forget the `await`?\nA: `await` pauses this coroutine until the awaited one finishes, then resumes with the result."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "completes, freezing everything else.\n\nQ: Why do we `await` here? What happens if you forget the `await`?\nA: `await` pauses this coroutine until the awaited one finishes, then resumes with the result. Without `await`, you get a coroutine object instead of the actual result — the code never actually runs.\n\nQ: What is the class `_DashboardHandler` responsible for? Why was it made a class instead of loose functions?\nA: A class bundles related data and behavior together. You use a class when multiple functions operate on the same state — instead of passing data between functions, the object holds it. It's about organizing responsibility."}], "complexity": 2126, "phase": "logic", "provider": "mentor"}

It lets you add behavior (logging, auth, caching) without changing the original function's code.\n\nQ: What's the difference between `async def` and `def`? When do you need async?\nA: `async def` creates a coroutine that can be paused/resumed. Use it when your function does I/O (API calls, file reads, database queries) and you want other tasks to run during the wait. Don't need it for pure computation.\n\nQ: When should you use a dict comprehension vs building a dict in a loop?\nA: Use comprehensions for simple transforms (under ~80 chars). Use a loop when you need conditionals, error handling, or the logic is complex enough that readability suffers. If you need to add a comment explaining the comprehension, use a loop.\n\nQ: When does a list comprehension become too complex and should be a regular loop?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is complex enough that readability suffers.

Rule of thumb: if it doesn't fit on one line or needs a comment, break it into a loop. Readability beats cleverness.\n\nQ: What does this lambda do? Could you replace it with a named function?\nA: A lambda is an anonymous one-line function: `lambda x: x*2` equals `def double(x): return x*2`. You can always replace a lambda with a named function. Lambdas are just shorter for simple callbacks and sort keys."}], "complexity": 2140, "phase": "logic", "provider": "mentor"}

Could you rewrite it as a regular for loop?\nA: A dict comprehension creates a dictionary in one expression: `{key: value for item in iterable}`.

Worse: when the logic needs a name to be understood, has multiple expressions, or needs to be reused. If you'd name it to explain it, don't use lambda."}], "complexity": 2167, "phase": "logic", "provider": "mentor"}
